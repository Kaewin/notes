    "- Storing infinitely many real numbers in a finite number of bits requires an approximate representation.\n",
    "- Most programs can store integer computations in 32 bits.\n",
    "- Real number calculations often produce quantities that cannot be exactly represented using a fixed number of bits and must be rounded.\n",
    "- Floating-point computation is characterized by rounding error.\n",
    "- Section 1.2 discusses how rounding error is measured.\n",
    "- Guard digits are a means of reducing error when subtracting nearby numbers.\n",
    "- The IEEE standard gives an algorithm for basic arithmetic operations and requires implementations to produce the same result as that algorithm.\n",
