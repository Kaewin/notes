    "## Tuning Model Hyperparameters with GridSearchCV\n",
    "\n",
    "- Non-parametric models like decision trees and k-nearest neighbors have various hyperparameters that can be specified.\n",
    "- Hyperparameters help balance the bias-variance trade-off and find the optimal model.\n",
    "- Writing clean, readable code with so many hyperparameter combinations can be difficult.\n",
    "- Scikit-learn has a tool called GridSearchCV for searching through a grid of hyperparameters.\n",
    "- This tool will be introduced in the section.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pickle and Model Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "- Shutting down your notebook kernel means your model disappears.\n",
    "- To use the model again, you'd need to re-train it, which is time-consuming.\n",
    "- Pickling your model stores it for later use without needing to re-train.\n",
    "- Pickled models are often used in model deployment and can be used as the backend of an API."

    "\n",
    "- Building and training a supervised learning model is an iterative process.\n",
    "- Improving model performance can be done by improving or engineering data, or finding good parameters to set when creating the model.\n",
    "- Setting the wrong parameters can cause overfitting or underfitting.\n",

    "\n",
    "- The sklearn library provides a way to tune model parameters through an exhaustive search using GridSearchCV.\n",
    "- GridSearchCV combines K-Fold Cross-Validation with a grid search of parameters.\n",
    "- To use GridSearchCV, create a parameter grid dictionary with keys as parameter names and values as values to try.\n",
    "- Pass the parameter grid dictionary to GridSearchCV along with the classifier.\n",
    "- K-fold cross-validation can also be used during this process by specifying the cv parameter.\n",
    "- GridSearchCV will run all combinations of parameters and default to the model with the best score.\n",
    "- Access the best combination of parameters by checking the best_params_ attribute."
